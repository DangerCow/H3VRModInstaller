# H3VRModInstaller

This is a program which installs mods for H3VR for you. The system that is used allows us to update mods automatically for H3VRMI without needing a new release. That being said, H3VRMI is currently NOT finished and is subject to updates/issues.

## How do I install H3VR Mod Installer?

First, install NET 5.0. You can [install it here.](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-5.0.1-windows-x64-installer)

Simply extract the zip to your h3vr folder (found by right clicking it in steam, hit manage, browse local files) so there's a folder in there called "H3VRMI". Once you're done, it should look like the picture below. Simply open the folder and launch the EXE inside.
