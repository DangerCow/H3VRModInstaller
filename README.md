## FAQ

Q: Can you show the percentage downloaded for the mods?

A: We can't, because we don't know. BoneTome (the primary supplier of mods in H3VRMI's database) uses a download protoc0l that does not tell us the size of the file.


Q: My H3VRMI won't start!

A: Make sure the location of H3VRModInstaller is **not** inside the root directory for H3. When this happens, it crashes because BepInEx tries to interfere with it.
